# GREEN
Repo for paper "GREEN: Towards Scalable Energy-Efficient Scheduling and Placement in the Cloud". 
This is the project for an energy-efficient scalable GNN-RL resource manager. The source code contains the GNN-RL implementation in DGL, PyTorch, and Numpy. Both RL environments including the simplified cloud simulator and the COSCO cloud simulator are also included.
